# Routex

## Description

The Routex app is a great way to unlock learning and sport locations. It's an easy-to-use location finding app that helps you find the perfect spot for your learning and sport activities. Whether you're looking for a place to practice your golf swing or a spot to learn a new language, the Routex app has something for everyone.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
